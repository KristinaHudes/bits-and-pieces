          <p class="question">Do you franchise? Can I open a Jeni's?</p>
          <div class="answer">
            Sorry, we do not franchise. We own and operate all of our scoop
            shops. While there are plenty of great franchised businesses out
            there, we prefer to remain exclusively in control of the quality of
            our products and services. Plus we love the day-to-day work of what
            we do!

          <p class="question">How much does shipping cost?</p>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              We offer flat-rate shipping in the United States based on the zip
              code of your shipping destination.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can order as little as 5 pints and as many as you like—and you
              still pay the same price per delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will ship your order as soon as possible and your account will
              be updated via email with tracking information as soon as the
              status of your order changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frozen goods shipped via flat-rate shipping arrive 1 to 2 days
              after being shipped, depending on the shipping destination. (At
              checkout, we’ll tell you the week your package will be delivered.)

            frozen, we’ll reship the order at our cost. Need customer service?
